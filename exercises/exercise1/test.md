**Objective**: The student should gain a comprehensive understanding of the three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, the student should gain an understanding of the key concepts of classification, regression, and cross-validation.

**Task 1 - Supervised Learning:**

Research and compare at least three supervised learning algorithms (e.g. k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic regression) and their use cases.
Understand the key concepts of classification and regression and give examples of each.
Select a supervised learning problem and explain how you would go about solving it, using the concepts you have learned.

**Task 2 - Unsupervised Learning:**

Research and compare at least three unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g. k-means, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis) and their use cases.
Understand the key concept of clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Research how unsupervised learning can be used to pre-process the data before using supervised learning algorithms.
Select one unsupervised learning problem and explain how you would go about solving it using the concepts you have learned.

**Task 3 - Reinforcement Learning:**

Research the basic concepts of reinforcement learning and at least one reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g. Q-learning, SARSA).
Understand the key concept of reward-based learning and the difference between supervised and reinforcement learning.
Research on the application of reinforcement learning in real-world scenarios, giving some examples of how it can be applied to the real world.
Select a reinforcement learning problem and explain how you would go about solving it using the concepts you have learned.

**Task 4 - Cross-Validation and Dataset Splitting:**

Research the importance of cross-validation and best-practice dataset splitting in evaluating the performance of machine learning models.
Understand the different types of cross-validation techniques, such as K-fold cross-validation, Leave-one-out cross-validation and Monte Carlo cross-validation.
Research the trade-offs between these methods and when to use them.
